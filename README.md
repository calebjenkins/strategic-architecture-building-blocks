# [Experimental] Strategic DDD Architecture Building Blocks

This repository catalogues a language for describing architectural concepts from a Strategic Domain-Driven Design perspective.

The goal of this repository is to create a shared language that practitioners can apply consistently across projects and domains. Less ambiguity should equally benefit newcomers to DDD and experienced practitioners.
